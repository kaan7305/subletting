---

## 1. Brand Identity & Positioning

### 1.1 Name Ideas

**Top Recommendations:**

1. **StayScholar** - Clean, memorable, emphasizes student focus
2. **LeaseLink** - Direct, professional, hints at connection
3. **NestQuarter** - Warm, seasonal (quarterly stays), nest = home
4. **StudyStay** - Simple, clear value proposition
5. **PadPass** - Modern, passport to global housing
6. **RoomRover** - Adventurous, exploration-focused
7. **QuarterKey** - Academic quarters + key to housing
8. **HomeBase Global** - Professional, international scope
9. **StayMate** - Friendly, companion on journey
10. **LeaseLodge** - Alliterative, trustworthy

**Recommended Choice: NestQuarter**
- Evocative and warm
- Suggests temporary but comfortable home
- "Quarter" references academic terms and minimum stay duration
- Easy to pronounce globally
- Available domains likely

### 1.2 Taglines

**Primary Options:**
- "Your home away from campus" (educational focus)
- "Flexible stays. Verified hosts. Student prices." (value prop)
- "Study anywhere. Stay everywhere." (global ambition)
- "Short-term living, long-term memories" (emotional)
- "The student housing platform built for real life" (authentic)

**Recommended: "Study anywhere. Stay everywhere."**

### 1.3 Value Proposition

**Core Differentiators vs. Competitors:**

| Platform | Limitation | NestQuarter Advantage |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Airbnb** | Expensive for students, nightly pricing, no academic focus | 2+ week pricing, student-verified discounts, academic calendar integration |
| **Booking.com** | Hotel-focused, short stays only, no community | Residential housing, flexible medium-term, student community |
| **SpareRoom** | UK-only, room shares, no booking protection | Global, full apartments + rooms, secure payment & contracts |
| **UniLodgers** | Limited cities, university-tied, expensive | Global reach, independent of universities, affordable |
| **HousingAnywhere** | High service fees (20%+), complex | Transparent 8-12% fee, simplified process |

**Key Value Props:**
1. **Affordability First** - Pricing structure optimized for student budgets
2. **Verified Safety** - All hosts undergo ID verification + property validation
3. **Flexible Duration** - 2 weeks to 12+ months, aligned with academic/internship needs
4. **Transparent Contracts** - Clear, legally-sound lease agreements in multiple languages
5. **Global Community** - Students helping students with reviews, tips, city guides
6. **Smart Filters** - Search by university proximity, budget, amenities relevant to students

```

### 5.4 Authentication Flow

**JWT-based Authentication:**

1. **User Registration:**
   - POST /api/auth/register with email + password
   - Server creates user, sends verification email
   - Returns access token (15min) + refresh token (7 days)

2. **Email Verification:**
   - User clicks link in email → GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=xxx
   - Server validates token, sets email_verified = true

3. **Login:**
   - POST /api/auth/login with email + password
   - Server validates credentials, returns tokens
   - Access token stored in memory, refresh token in httpOnly cookie

4. **Token Refresh:**
   - When access token expires, client sends refresh token
   - POST /api/auth/refresh-token
   - Server validates refresh token, issues new access token

5. **OAuth Login (Google, Facebook):**
   - GET /api/auth/google → redirects to Google OAuth
   - Callback: /api/auth/google/callback
   - Server creates/finds user, returns tokens

**Authorization Middleware:**

```javascript
const requireAuth = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1]
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' })

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET)
    req.userId = decoded.userId
    next()
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' })
  }
}

const requireHost = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user.user_type !== 'host' && req.user.user_type !== 'both') {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Hosts only' })
  }
  next()
}
```

### 5.5 Security Requirements

**Critical Security Measures:**

1. **Data Encryption:**
   - All passwords hashed with bcrypt (12+ rounds)
   - Sensitive data (IDs, bank details) encrypted at rest (AES-256)
   - All API traffic over HTTPS/TLS 1.3
   - Database connections encrypted

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate all inputs with Zod/Joi schemas
   - Sanitize user-generated content (prevent XSS)
   - Parameterized SQL queries (prevent SQL injection)
   - Rate limiting on all endpoints (express-rate-limit)

3. **Authentication:**
   - Multi-factor authentication (SMS/TOTP) optional
   - Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
   - Session invalidation on password change
   - Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens

4. **Authorization:**
   - Role-based access control (guest, host, admin)
   - Property access checks (hosts can only edit their own)
   - Booking access (only guest + host can view)

5. **Payment Security:**
   - PCI DSS compliance via Stripe
   - Never store raw card numbers
   - Tokenize payment methods
   - 3D Secure for high-value transactions

6. **File Upload Security:**
   - Validate file types (images only for photos)
   - Scan for malware (ClamAV)
   - Limit file sizes (10MB max)
   - Generate unique filenames (prevent overwrite)
   - Store in isolated S3 bucket with restricted access

7. **API Security:**
   - CORS whitelist for allowed origins
   - CSRF protection for state-changing operations
   - Rate limiting: 100 req/min per IP, 500 req/min per user
   - Request signing for webhooks (Stripe, etc.)

8. **Monitoring:**
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Alert on suspicious activity (mass requests, failed logins)
   - Monitor for SQL injection attempts
   - Track API error rates

9. **Privacy Compliance:**
   - GDPR compliance (EU users)
   - Data retention policies (delete after X years)
   - Right to be forgotten (data deletion endpoint)
   - Clear privacy policy + terms of service

10. **Infrastructure:**
    - Regular security audits
    - Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
    - Secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)
    - Backup encryption
    - DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
